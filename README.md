This is a template for [Generamba](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/Generamba) code generator *(by Rambler Digital Solutions)* that we use at ideil.

The name of the template is __viper_arch__ and it is to be used with [ViperArch](https://github.com/ideil/ios-viper-arch) framework and [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject).

Template generates all the needed Viper module components as well as module assembly with dependency injection.

**Generamba** is a code generator made for working with Xcode. Primarily it is designed to generate VIPER modules but it is quite easy to customize it for generation of any other classes (both in Objective-C and Swift).

The detailed information about a template structure is available in [Generamba Wiki](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/Generamba/wiki/Template-Structure).
